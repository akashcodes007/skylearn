AI Prompt for a Scalable LMS with Notes, Mock Interviews, and a LeetCode-Style Coding Platform
"Build a highly scalable Learning Management System (LMS) that serves as an all-in-one platform for students, educators, and interview preparation. The LMS should integrate advanced features, including AI-generated notes, mock interview scheduling, and a fully interactive coding platform similar to LeetCode. The system should support both MCQ-based and coding-based assessments, allowing both admins and users to create and upload tests. The platform should be designed for high concurrency and optimized for performance to handle thousands of students simultaneously."

Core Features & Functionalities:
1. AI-Generated Notes & Study Materials
AI automatically generates structured notes from uploaded PDFs, videos, or teacher input.

Students can search for topics, and AI provides contextual summaries and explanations.

AI-powered question generation from notes for self-assessment.

Supports multimedia (text, images, videos, and interactive diagrams).

Version control for updated notes by teachers/admins.

2. Mock Interview Scheduling System
AI-driven scheduling assistant that allows students to book mock interviews.

Live interview environment with a video call + AI-powered interviewer bot.

AI evaluates performance and provides detailed feedback with confidence scores, strengths & weaknesses, and improvement suggestions.

Supports both technical (DSA, system design) and behavioral (HR) interviews.

Option for human interviewers (pro) who are assigned dynamically.

3. Coding Platform (LeetCode-Style)
Fully integrated coding environment where students can practice DSA, system design, and competitive programming.

Real-time code execution with support for multiple languages (C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.).

AI-powered hints & explanations for coding questions.

Time & space complexity analysis for submitted solutions.

Live contests & leaderboards for competitive programming.

4. Customizable MCQ & Coding-Based Tests
Admins or users can upload and schedule tests.

Multiple question formats: MCQs, coding challenges, fill-in-the-blanks, and descriptive answers.

Automated test evaluation: AI grades MCQs instantly and runs test cases for coding challenges.

Cheat detection system that tracks tab-switching, face detection (via webcam), and AI-generated answer detection.

Ranking system for students based on test performance.

5. Scalability & Performance
Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure) to handle large concurrent users.

Load balancing & caching for faster response times.

Optimized database design (NoSQL + SQL hybrid) to manage high-volume user data.

CDN integration for fast content delivery of study materials, videos, and notes.

AI-powered recommendation system for personalized learning paths.

6. User Roles & Access Control
Students: Access to notes, tests, mock interviews, and coding practice.

Admins/Teachers: Create & upload content, track student progress, schedule tests & interviews.

Interviewers (AI/Human): Conduct interviews and provide feedback.

7. Gamification & Progress Tracking
Badges, achievements, and streaks for student motivation.

AI-powered insights on strengths, weaknesses, and suggested learning plans.

Leaderboard & peer competition to encourage engagement.
